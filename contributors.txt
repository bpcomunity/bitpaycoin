The previous description is below when first doing the POD is below:
Amando has been face verified by various online sources including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, as well as University profile sites in which his doctorate is in process. Leandro has been face verified by his Brazilian identity, Facebook, Twitter, and submitted image. Both have submitted their email addresses, phone numbers, and personal Skype.
Amando is an instructional designer and is currently in a doctorate program for Instructional Technology. Leandro states that he has advanced coding experience in C++, MSSQL, is Microsoft licensed with Visual Studio, specialized on Unix systems, with experience in computer sciences in Brazil.
This is Amando’s first coin. Leandro is the owner of Nimbus, has made some improvements on code of some coins and states that he is “scam buster” or “scam sniffer” on Bitcointalk forum. Amando and Leandro are the only developers that have access to the GitHub.
The best way to contact Amando and Leandro is through the Twitter: @BitpayCoin. There has been no in person contact, and no video submission or chat. Leandro has submitted two forms of documents from third party sources one in which comes verified from that REPÚBLICA FEDERATIVA DO BRASIL. With the above information along with other personal information that I have gathered about the developers of BitpayCoin [BP] or [/] the rating of 5 PODs has been given.
